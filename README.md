## Code Snippet

The code below displays the logic added to the putDb method that accepts text inputted into the editor and adds the content to the database.

```
export const putDb = async (content) => {
  // Create a connection to the database and the version we want to use
  const jateDb = await openDB('jate', 1);
  // Create a new transaction and specify the "jate" database and data privileges
  const tx = jateDb.transaction('jate', 'readwrite');
  // Open up the desired object store
  const store = tx.objectStore('jate');
  // Use the .add() method on the store and pass in the content
  const request = store.add({ content: content });
  // Get a confirmation of the request
  const result = await request;
  console.log("Data has been saved to the database");
};
```
